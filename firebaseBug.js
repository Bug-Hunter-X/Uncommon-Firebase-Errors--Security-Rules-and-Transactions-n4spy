The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the rules are incorrectly set up in the Firebase console. For example, if the rules are too restrictive, the client might not be able to read or write data, even if the code is correct.  Another uncommon issue is when using transactions,  incorrectly handling concurrent modifications. If two clients attempt to modify the same data simultaneously using transactions, without proper handling, it could lead to unexpected behavior or data loss. Incorrectly configured security rules, combined with improper transaction handling, often results in cryptic errors that are hard to diagnose.
