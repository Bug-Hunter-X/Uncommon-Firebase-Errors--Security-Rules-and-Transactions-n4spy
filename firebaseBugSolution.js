To fix the security rules issue, carefully review your Firebase Realtime Database Rules in the Firebase console. Ensure that they allow the necessary read and write operations for your client application.  For the transaction issue, implement proper error handling within your transaction code.  Use try...catch blocks to handle potential errors, and consider using a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to gracefully manage concurrent modifications.  Additionally, ensure your transaction logic is idempotent to prevent unexpected side effects if a transaction is retried.
